Hi, I’m @KalRSilva.

I am a student at the Universidade Metodista de São Paulo (UMESP).
I started my programming journey with Python, but eventually found my passion for coding in Java.
In recent months, Java Spring has become my primary focus, motivating me to pursue a career in Backend Development.

My experience includes:

-Company challenges
-Microservices
-Personal projects
-Documentation for those

My main goal is to one day work as a Backend Developer, also to improve my skills as a Programmer/employee.
